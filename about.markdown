# *Changing the way digital history is done.*

Recent developments have paved the way for a revolution in the way we apprehend and explain the past. Traditional historical research has been leveraged but also destabilised by the increasing accessibility of digitized sources and computational tools for analysis. A flood of data and push-button technologies has threatened to obscure through abundance and instil in scholars a false sense of mastery. As historians, we find ourselves at a crossroads, the transition to the digital constituting a crisis but also an extraordinary opportunity to transform our field: to do (digital) history differently.

Here at the Digital History Advanced Research Projects Accelerator (DHARPA), we are building a diverse and interdisciplinary research and development team to support this transformation. We aim to do more than just build a bigger toolbox. Based in the [University of Luxembourg’s](https://wwwen.uni.lu/) [Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C<sup>2</sup>DH),](https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/) DHARPA supports the centre’s remit to self-reflexively examine the interaction of technology and historical practice. Software has often been a black box. The digital humanities have often been a spectacle. Historical inquiry itself has in some ways been like a “Mechanical Turk,” with the decisions and interventions made by the researcher hidden from view and only the well-oiled and seemingly autonomous product on display. We want to encourage historians to lift the lid. We want digital historians to see how the application of their expertise works in tandem with technology to produce knowledge, how even digitally enabled research is not a thing but a process, reliant on the critical engagement of the scholar.

# *DHARPA has four facets:*

*Software and methodology development:*
Our interactive software and methodologies will cultivate the holistic practice of interweaving data, code, computational functionality, and metadata with a narrative of historian’s choices and actions. Documenting academic labour makes its value evident, while also making it reproducible and keeping it honest: it allows scholars to take ownership of their interventions.

*Collaborations:*
DHARPA will staff and launch a responsive laboratory that can rapidly prototype and launch applied solutions. We will be working with other academics here at the C2DH but also welcome collaborations within a wider, international and interdisciplinary scholarly community. Please get in touch!

*Training and outreach:*
As the project progresses, we will be introducing our software to the academic community through workshops at the University of Luxembourg and international conferences as well as through publications. Further to our ethos that scholarship is an iterative process, we welcome your feedback to improve our software and specifications. Please see our publications page and calendar of events for more information, and check out our blog for the latest news and musings on the project.

*Infrastructure:*
DHARA will be building a generalizable infrastructure for hosting software and collaborator projects that ensures privacy, portability, and sustainability. Click here to find out more.
