Central to DHARPA is the creation of a Virtual Research Environment that will enable scholars to engage with their data while promoting critical historical practice. Our software will be free and open-source and backed by a long-term sustainability plan and training opportunities to encourage widespread and confident adoption.


Built for both humanities scholars and social scientists, we plan to include modules for:

* Data ingestion
* Textual analysis
* Network analysis
* Geographical analysis

â€¦and bring them within a seamless environment, where work can flow between tasks from experimentation and modelling to presentation and dissemination.

Once produced, you will have the option to run the software remotely or to download the software for local use.


*Please check back later for software downloads and a calendar of workshops and events*
